### to make typescript configuration, type command line below:

```
./node_modules/.bin/tsc --init
```

### to make sequelize init, type command line below:

```
./node_modules/.bin/sequelize-cli init
```

OR

```
npx sequelize-cli init
```

### to be highlighted

- by adding --underscored when generate model in sequelize, it can generate underscore instead of camelCase for name of column.
- since using docker with different port for db, in db config need to add PORT.
